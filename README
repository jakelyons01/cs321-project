CS321 final project: Linear space-complexity local alignment

Authors: Jake Lyons and Jaime Robinson

This repository implements a local alignment algorithm that uses linear space
complexity. The algorithm uses the NumPy package, which is free
and publicly available. 

The alignment algorithms use the PAM250 alignment matrix. Python code was
compiled to C using Cython package. 

USAGE: python3 linear_local.py <input_file>
